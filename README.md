Gold Price Forecasting with Autoregression (Time Series Analysis)

## Context

Gold, a valuable and lustrous metal, has fascinated humanity for centuries. It has been used for various purposes, including jewelry and investment. Gold is globally traded on commodity exchanges.

## Autoregression

A time series is a sequence of measurements of the same variable(s) made over time. Usually, the measurements are made at evenly spaced times - for example, monthly or yearly. Let us first consider the problem in which we have a y-variable measured as a time series.
In this context, we might have **_y_** a measure of the gold price, with measurements observed every 3 months. To emphasize that we have measured values over time, we use **_t_** as a subscript rather than the usual "**i**," i.e., means **_y_** measured in time period **_t_**. The $\epsilon$ is the error term (typically normally distributed). [1]

An autoregressive model is when a value from a time series is regressed on previous values from that same time series. for example,
$y_{t}$ on $y_{t-1}$ [1]:

$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_{1} y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$

## Data

Data from Kaggle with a CC0 licence. [2]

File CSV has 10788 rows, and the last date is 2020-03-13.

## Implementation

The implementation of gold price forecasting is done in a Jupyter Notebook.
